# ember-lang-lowering-yard

`ember-lang-lowering-yard` explores compilers in Julia. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Ember Lang Lowering Yard Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Why This Exists

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Feature Notes

- Models source form with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep intermediate state changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for bytecode output, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents evaluation checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Implementation Notes

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying compilers behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Julia project keeps the model in a small module with assertions in a local test script.

## Code Tour

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Local Setup

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Example Scenarios

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Boundaries

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.

## Roadmap

- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add one more compilers fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
